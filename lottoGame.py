# . Create a Lotto game:
#  Puts in a list of 6 numbers, between 1-37, as in a real lottery. V
#  The numbers must not be repeated. V
#  Each game (row) in Lotto costs 3 ILS, Insert how much money do you have? V
#  Random 6 numbers â€“ the winner's number. V
#  Then play few rounds (rows) as your budget can handle.
#  On each round, random 6 numbers , between 1-37, and check if you won.
#  In the end sum the entire prize from all rounds.

# If you guess:
# 6 numbers = won 1M ILS
# 5 numbers = won 5000 ILS
# 4 numbers = won 100 ILS
# 3 numbers = won 10 ILS
